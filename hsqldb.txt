There’s a tool available in hsqldb.jar for examining and updating HSQLDB databases
outside Java programs.  To use this get a command tool or PowerShell window,
make sure you are in the folder containing the database files and give the
command

java -cp \tomcat\lib\hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager

(If you are using your own machine and the tomcat folder is not located at the top
level you may need to use a different folder name.) 

A new window will appear. To use the tool to examine and update the database
for the assignment set the URL in this window (which will show something like
jdbc:hsqldb:mem:.) to be jdbc:hsqldb:file:shopdb. (If you give a name in the Setting name
field you will be able to select it from Recent settingswhen examining the database again later.)

Note that you will not be able to open the database while it is in use in a
program being run in the Tomcat server or in IntelliJ IDEA; if a program has
terminated abruptly without closing the database you may need to remove a file
called shopdb.lck to allow the database to be accessed; doing this is harmless
as long as the database in not in use in a program.

Once the database has been opened in the window you can use the Command menu
to perform SQL queries and updates such as SELECT and INSERT to query and modify the
database.
